I used teensy 3.6;
audio comes from dac0 and dac1;
controlled by MIDI from (DAW's) {MIDI.h};
polyphonic multiwaveform stereo synth with Amplitude Modulation and Reverb {Audio.h};

ROUTING

dc1 = pwm of waveforms
dc3 = pwm of lfo's
multiply1= amplitude modulation
dc2 = necessary for using envelope (1.0 setuped)
